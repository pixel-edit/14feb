            It‚Äôs incredible to think how just a few months ago, I didn‚Äôt even know
            who you were. Meeting you through Instagram was a chance I‚Äôm
            forever grateful for. In the beginning, I wasn‚Äôt sure how we would
            connect, how we‚Äôd talk, or how you‚Äôd be. But now, after months
             of talking, I‚Äôve come to realize something‚Äîyou're absolutely
            amazing.

            Talking to you has quickly become one of my favorite parts of the
            day. Every time I see a message from you, I can't help but smile. It
            feels like my day instantly gets brighter just because of our
            conversation. I have muted notifications from every app, including Instagram DMs,
            just to make sure that whenever I get a notification, it's from you.
            You're not just great to look at; your personality makes you even more special.

            I sometimes wish I could meet you in person instantly, but I know it might be
            a long shot. Still, I hope that, even though we've only known each
            other for 9months but the bond between us is definately i inseparable.
           No matter what, I wish you a life filled with happiness, peace, and everything you truly
            deserve. And definately i will always be here to support you whenever thing go wrong.
